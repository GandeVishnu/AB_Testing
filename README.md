# 📈 **Evaluating Conversion Impact of AD vs. PSA Exposure Using A/B Testing**

## 🛠 **Tools Used**
- **Power BI** – for interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Python** – for data analysis and statistical comparison between PSA and PA/AD exposure groups.

## 📊 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on evaluating the conversion impact of **Public Service Announcement (PSA)** versus **Advertisement (PA/AD)** exposure through an **A/B Testing** approach. The goal is to compare the effectiveness of both campaigns based on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

📌 **Users**  
💵 **Total Ads**  
🎯 **Converted (Purchases)**  
🛒 **Unique Ads Count**  
💡 **Conversion Rate**  
📦 **Ad Exposure by Day**

| **Best Day (Highest Exposure)** | Thursday: 104.24k             | Friday: 2464.50k            | Friday: 2464.50k           |

## 📌 **The primary goal** was to compare the effectiveness of PSA and PA/AD exposure based on metrics like:

💰 **Conversion Rate**  
📣 **Reach**  
📈 **Cost per Purchase**  
✅ **Total Conversions**

---

## ✅ **Final Outcome**

- **PA or AD** campaigns outperformed **PSA** with a higher **conversion rate** of **2.56%** compared to **1.79%** for PSA.
- **PA or AD** also had the highest number of **converted purchases**, with **564.58k** conversions.
- The **best performing day** for both campaigns was **Friday**, showing the highest ad exposure and engagement.

Overall, **PA or AD** showed better **ROI** and **conversion performance**, making it the recommended strategy for future digital marketing campaigns.
